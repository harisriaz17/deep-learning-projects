###### WHAT IS THIS?
This repository contains the code/solutions of all the excercises that I attempted when I took the Stanford Introduction to Machine Learning course (CS-229) taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera. If you are taking the class, fork my repo and put your solutions in a different branch. HOWEVER, please **DO NOT** refer any code in my repo before the due date and **NEVER** post any code in my repo according to "Stanford Honor Code" below. Questions or pointing out is always welcome, please send me a mail.

###### Stanford Honor Code

"We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
